# transfer-zurich

Repository of the transfer-zurich webapplication. This repository will be mostly used by DAKA and DOOK. Need to set up Github with phpstorm. The .js and bootstrap must be downloaded separtly or we just upload them as file. A other way would be let the link to the site from where it is in. And not downloading it.
